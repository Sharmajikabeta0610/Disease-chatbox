                    Cancer can affect virtually any organ or tissue in the body, and its severity can vary widely, from slow-growing and relatively harmless tumors to highly aggressive and life-threatening forms.`,

<li><strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> It uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells. It may be given after surgery to prevent recurrence or before surgery to shrink the tumor.</li>
<li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> It uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. It may be given before or after surgery, or as the main treatment for advanced cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Hormone Therapy:</strong> It blocks the effects of estrogen or progesterone, hormones that can fuel some breast cancers. It may be given after surgery or as a preventive measure for high-risk women.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Therap:</strong> It uses drugs that target specific characteristics of cancer cells, such as a protein called HER2. It may be given with chemotherapy or alone for HER2-positive breast cancer.</li>
<li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> It uses drugs that stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. It may be given for certain types of breast cancer that have a high number of gene mutations or express a protein called PD-L1.

<li>Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease often retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body.</li>
<li>Medications to treat anemia. Supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron, help produce more red blood cells. This might relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia.</li>
<li>Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor might recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often have high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease.</li>
<li>Medications to protect your bones. Calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You might also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification).</li>
<li>A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor might recommend eating less protein. A registered dietitian can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet.</li>
